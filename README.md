## Overview

*What problem are we solving?*

It is hard to manage “to dos” across people. It isn’t always clear who owns which task and when it needs to be done by. Not having a clear dashboard with ownership and due dates outlined makes for unnecessary confusion and conflict.

*Who is our user?*

Any person who needs to keep track of items can use our product, but we are particularly targeting families and roommates as living in groups has the acute pain point of needing clearly outlined ownership of tasks.
